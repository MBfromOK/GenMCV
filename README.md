AFAICS last update was Feb 2016

Have tried to contact Graham about this code via web2pyslices - user registration is locked down (no new users allowed to register).

Only contact information available on olympic's site is a sales e-mail, reply pending.

I downloaded the source files and tried to use it with Python 3.7, code syntax is invalid, this is a rework, for my own benefit, and made publically available like the original.

I will support it best I can, but the whole reason I am using it is that I am struggling to understand the web2py MVC structure, building custom ?frameworks? and the web2py customization process.
