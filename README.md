Posted 3 years ago by graham ranson with source code hosted from http://www.olympic.co.uk/pythondev/.

AFAICS last update was Feb 2016

Have tried to contact Graham about this code, web2pylices user registration is locked down (no new users allowed to register); no contact information available on olympic's site.

I downloaded the code and tried to use it with Python 3.7, code syntax is invalid, this is a rework, for my own benefit, and made publically available like the original.

I will support it best I can, but the whole reason I am using it is that I am struggling to understand the MVC building process.
